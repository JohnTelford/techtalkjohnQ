# About

> I am the sole proprietor of *JohnTelford.com LLC*. It is a  technology consulting company working with client  development projects for more that 30 years.

## Nuggets
Way back when the Internet web browsers and programming languages came along, I became interested in web technologies, and began learn by doing technology deep dives. I have years of learning ever changing Electronics, Internet, and Software technologies by hands-on experiencing the technologies du jour.

I have a passion pursuing what’s new and improved with these industries. Checking out what’s new or not, a pipe dream or not, or what’s new and improved, is like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily, every so often one finds interesting technology nuggets making the effort worthwhile. I use the [Hype Curve](https://johntelford.com/hypecycle.html) as a guide.


I am an Electronics, Software, and Web Engineer specializing in website hardware and software technology disciplines:

- Architecture
- Development
- Deployment

## Contact

A labyrinth symbolizes possible difficulties reaching website project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines may be helpful.
