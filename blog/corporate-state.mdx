# The Corporate State

The Corporate State is the state being subordinate to corporations. Fascism is corporations being subordinate to the state

Charles Reich wrote in his [The Greening of America](https://www.amazon.com/Greening-America-25th-Anniversary/dp/0517886367/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KVZE3A9NGV9R&keywords=the+greening+of+america&qid=1567352124&s=gateway&sprefix=the+greening%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-3) book that the words from the Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln “.. government of the people, by the people, and for the people..” have been perverted to “.. government of The Corporate State, by The Corporate State, and for The Corporate State, at the expense of the people..”

## Warning About The Corporate State

Dwight D. Eisenhower as the 34th President of the United States, delivered his farewell address to the nation in a television broadcast on January 17, 1961. Perhaps best known for advocating that the nation guard against the potential influence of the military–industrial complex

It seems Eisenhower’s warning hasn’t been taken seriously. The United States spends more on its defense budget than China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, France, and Japan combined. The United States is also the worlds top arms dealer.

## Bribery and Extortion

The Corporate State and politicians run on money. The Corporate State from profits and some politicians from Super Political Action Committee (PACs).

Political Action Committee (PAC) — A popular term for a political committee organized for raising and spending money to elect and defeat candidates. A new type of PAC was created called [Super PACs](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php/). These PACs make no contributions to candidates or parties. They do, however make independent expenditures for running ads or sending mail or communicating in other ways with messages that specifically advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates or ballot propositions. There are no limits or restrictions on the sources of funds that may be used for these expenditures. These committees file regular financial reports with the FEC which include their donors along with their expenditures. View the current list of Super PACs 2

Some politicians do The Corporate State bidding with the promises of contributions to Super PACs benefiting them or attacking opponents. This a legal form of bribery. In turn, some politicians threaten to withhold support for The Corporate State enterprise interests without contributions to the Super PACs benefiting them. This is a legal form of extortion.

The messengers of The Corporate State are lobbyist flooding the corridors of Congress. Some were once members of Congress.

Some messengers get appointed to head government department that are helping or hindering The Corporate State enterprises.

## Stranglehold

The Corporate State stranglehold has grown so tight. I think it will continue until it strangles itself
