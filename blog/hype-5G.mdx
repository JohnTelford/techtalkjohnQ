# Hype-5G

Big time [5G](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=5G) hype started early at the Hype Curve *Technology Trigger* by major carriers.

A 2019 survey reported 5G hype is working as 1/3 of smartphone owners think they have a 5G devices and service, but they Superdon't. Since then major carriers have ramped up their hype machines and it is working. More 5G phones being are being sold now but more smartphone owners think they have reliable 5G service, but they don't.

A few of those with 5G smartphones are experiencing 5G service. Illinois has the top 5G availability of 27.6% of the time, representing the proportion of time those users with 5G devices and subscription had an active 5G connection. Higher urban population areas like Illinois is where the money is for major carriers.

Some of the reasons for such service are the flavors of 5G.

- Low-Band

- Mid-Band

- High-Band

The higher the band the faster transmission speed. But fails reaching very far or penetrating buildings and the High-Band degrades traveling a few hundred feet of open air.
