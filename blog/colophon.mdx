#  Colophon

## John Telford

The latest incarnation of the [John Telford](https://johntelford.com/) website is built using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) site generator

## Tech Talk John

The latest incarnation of the [TechTalkJohn Blog](https://techtalkjohnblog.pages.dev/2022-12-31-welcome) is what you are viewing. It is built using the  blog components of the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site generator.  

The [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) site generator has the out-of-the-box features I was looking for, so I reincarnated  [TechTalkJohn](https://techtalkjohnblog.pages.dev) blog websites using it 


I chose this site generator because:

- Docusaurus abstracts [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
- Posts are written use [MDX](https://johntelford.com/programming#mdx)
	- Embedded [JSX](https://johntelford.com/programming#jsx/) and [HTML](https://johntelford.com/programming#hypertext-markup-language-html)
	- MDX is compiled to the troika of [HTML](https://johntelford.com/programming#hypertext-markup-language-html), [CSS](https://johntelford.com/programming#css), and [JavaScript](https://johntelford.com/programming#javascript) standard website programming languages
	- The blog sidebar on the left side of the screen displays a list of blog posts
- The right menu is the selected blog post headers levels
- Click menu bar *Blog Tags* for a list of blog post with tags. Click a tag for all blog posts with that tag
- Multiple tags can be assigned to blog posts
- Light or dark theme toggle

## Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static-site documentation site generator. It is an open-source website generator created by Facebook. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, and extracts [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### Features

### out-of-the-box

The out-of-the-box features I was looking for are:

#### Components

- JSX embedded in blog and MDX documents
- Extend and customize with React
- A [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) implemented site generator

#### Development

- Hot web browser reloading with fast edit changes incremental builds
- Route-based code and data splitting
- Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
- Publish Vercel 
 
#### Sidebar Menu

The Docusaurus sidebar menu is feature rich, flexible, and not difficult to configure, unlike others I have experienced in my deep technology dives.

There are different types of sidebar items:

- [Doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-doc): link to a doc page, assigning it to the sidebar

- [Ref](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-ref): link to a doc page, without assigning it to the sidebar

- [Link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-link): link to any internal or external page

- [Category](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-category): create a hierarchy of sidebar items

- [Autogenerated](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-autogenerated): generate a sidebar slice automatically

#### Files

- A website integrated blog
- Automatic last update date of file
- File tags

#### User Experience
